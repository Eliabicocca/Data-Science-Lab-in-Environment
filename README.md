# Data-Science-Lab-in-Environment
Project for Data Science Lab in Environment. 
Master's degree in Data Science, 2019

Analyze and compare two geospatial datasets.
Constraints for the exercise:
- 2 different datasets (e.g. model and observations, n different models, 2 different observational datasets, etc.)
- Perform at least 1 operation in space and 1 operation in time (e.g. aggregation, normalization, resampling, regridding etc.)
- Display data both as function of space and time (time series and maps) - 
Use some sort of statistical analysis on the data (arrange the data according to some pdf, hypothesis testing,
time series analysis, detection of trends, etc.)

You can find a pdf with the presentation of the project and a markdown file with Python code.
